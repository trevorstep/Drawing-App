## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Occasionally the line will jump making a sharp edge when it should be round. For now im pretending like that's a feature...  but its definetly not intended. 
* [ ] I want to add a save option, or an option to allow users to make a profile of some kind.
* [ ] Somtimes you need to click multiple times to get the brush to stop painting, so I think that would be good to fix sooner rather than later.....
